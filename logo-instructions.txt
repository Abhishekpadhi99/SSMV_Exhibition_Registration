LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

CURRENT STATUS:
- The website now uses an icon-based logo (calendar icon in indigo box)
- This works immediately without needing an image file

TO REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN IMAGE LOGO:

1. Prepare your logo image:
   - Recommended format: PNG (with transparent background) or JPG
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square format works best)
   - File name: logo.png (or logo.jpg)

2. Place the logo file:
   - Save your logo image in the same folder as index.html
   - Make sure the file is named exactly "logo.png"

3. Update the HTML files:
   Replace this code in all 4 HTML files (index.html, booking.html, admin.html, login.html):

   FROM:
   <div class="h-10 w-10 mr-3 bg-indigo-600 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
       <i class="fas fa-calendar-check text-white text-xl"></i>
   </div>

   TO:
   <img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" class="h-10 w-10 mr-3 object-contain">

4. Adjust logo size (optional):
   - Current size: h-10 w-10 (40x40 pixels)
   - Larger: h-12 w-12 (48px) or h-16 w-16 (64px)
   - Smaller: h-8 w-8 (32px)

5. Change icon color (optional):
   - Change bg-indigo-600 to: bg-blue-600, bg-purple-600, bg-green-600, etc.
   - Change text-white to: text-yellow-400, text-blue-200, etc.

Note: The current icon-based logo will display properly without any additional files.
