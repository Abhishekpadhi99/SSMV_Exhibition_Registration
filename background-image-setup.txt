BACKGROUND IMAGE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

The homepage now supports a background image with a semi-transparent overlay.

HOW TO ADD YOUR BACKGROUND IMAGE:

1. Prepare your image:
   - Recommended format: JPG or PNG
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 pixels or larger (Full HD)
   - File should be optimized (compressed) for web use
   - Suggested file size: Under 500KB for fast loading

2. Save your image:
   - Place your image file in the same folder as index.html
   - Name it: background.jpg (or background.png)

3. If using a different filename:
   - Open index.html
   - Find the line: style="background-image: url('background.jpg');"
   - Change 'background.jpg' to your filename

CURRENT SETUP:
- Background image: background.jpg
- Overlay: Purple-pink-indigo gradient with 60-70% opacity
- Text color: White with drop shadow for readability
- Feature cards: White background (unchanged)

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:

A. Change overlay color/opacity:
   Find this line in index.html:
   <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-900/70 via-pink-900/60 to-indigo-900/70"></div>
   
   Change colors:
   - from-purple-900/70 → from-blue-900/70 (blue overlay)
   - via-pink-900/60 → via-red-900/60 (red overlay)
   - to-indigo-900/70 → to-green-900/70 (green overlay)
   
   Change opacity (0-100):
   - /70 = 70% opacity (darker)
   - /50 = 50% opacity (medium)
   - /30 = 30% opacity (lighter)

B. Remove overlay (show image only):
   Delete or comment out this line:
   <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-900/70 via-pink-900/60 to-indigo-900/70"></div>

C. Use solid color overlay instead:
   Replace the gradient line with:
   <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-black/50"></div>
   (This creates a 50% black overlay)

TIPS:
- Use high-quality images for professional look
- Ensure text remains readable on your chosen image
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices
- Consider using images related to appointments/scheduling

EXAMPLE IMAGES TO USE:
- Office/workspace photos
- Calendar/planner images
- Professional meeting rooms
- Abstract patterns
- Your organization's building/logo

Note: If no background.jpg file is found, the page will show the overlay color only.
